# CMS Speed Up plugin for Craft CMS

Performs a CMS Speed Up after an update is completed.

This plugin has been built to follow the recommendations made in https://zacharyflower.com/tutorials/2017/02/27/speed-up-craft-admin.html and also address the issue of what happens after a cms update

## Installation

To install CMS Speed Up, follow these steps:

1. Download & unzip the file and place the `cmsspeedup` directory into your `craft/plugins` directory
2.  -OR- do a `git clone ???` directly into your `craft/plugins` folder.  You can then update it with `git pull`
3. Install plugin in the Craft Control Panel under Settings > Plugins
4. The plugin folder should be named `cmsspeedup` for Craft to see it.  GitHub recently started appending `-master` (the branch name) to the name of the folder for zip file downloads.

CMS Speed Up works on Craft 2.4.x and Craft 2.5.x.
